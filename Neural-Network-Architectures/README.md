# Deep Learning Project

## Overview
A collection of deep learning experiments exploring **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**,  
**Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, **data pipeline strategies**, and a **capstone project on waste classification**.

## Key Components
- **CNNs**  
  - Implementations in both **Keras** and **PyTorch**.  
  - Comparative analysis of frameworks for image classification tasks.  
  - PyTorch classifier built from scratch with training and validation monitoring.

- **Vision Transformers**  
  - Implementations in Keras and PyTorch.  
  - Exploration of hybrid CNN-ViT architectures.  
  - Analysis of training performance and efficiency vs CNNs.

- **Predictors**  
  - **Breast Cancer Classification** using a DNN on the Wisconsin dataset.  
  - Comparative study of **memory-based vs generator-based data loading**.  
  - Predictive modelling pipelines with cross-validation.

- **Capstone Project**  
  - **Waste product image classification** using transfer learning and fine-tuning.  
  - Demonstrates model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
